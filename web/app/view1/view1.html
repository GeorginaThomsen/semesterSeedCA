                <p>Our test strategy was mostly concentrated on using PostMan instead of using the Rest Assured testing platform<br/>
                This strategy was quite useful for our team, except that we had to create and run the tests manually from Postman, instead of having our tests automated by RestAssured
                <br/>
                For testing the facade classes and the XML handler service we used Junit tests</p>
